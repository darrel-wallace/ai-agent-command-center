## Strengths & Weaknesses Analysis

### Strengths
1. Standard wireless Android Auto is a plus.
2. Towing capacity is excellent for the class.
3. Used market pricing is likely to be favorable.

### Weaknesses
1. **Payload capacity on off-road trims is a major drawback.**
2. Fuel economy is not a strong point.
3. Automatic locking differential is less desirable than a selectable locker.

### Unique Considerations
- The Colorado's payload limitations in the off-road trims make it a less suitable choice for the project's needs compared to the Ford Ranger.

## Recommended Configuration for Project Requirements

**Suggested Trim:** LT 4WD
**Reasoning:** While the off-road trims are not suitable due to payload, the LT offers a good balance of features and can be a capable platform if modified with aftermarket parts. However, this would require careful management of weight to stay within payload limits.

**Configuration:**
- Cab: Crew Cab
- Bed: Short Box
- Engine: 2.7L TurboMax
- Key Options: Convenience Package II, Trailer Tow Package

**Projected Costs:**
- New MSRP: ~$38,250
- Estimated Spring 2027 used: ~$23,000 - $27,000
- Budget fit: Good

## Research Notes

- The primary limiting factor for the Colorado is its payload capacity in the off-road-oriented trims.
- The 2.7L TurboMax engine is required for maximum towing.
