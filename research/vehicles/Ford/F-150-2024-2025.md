Here is the research on the 2024-2025 Ford F-150 SuperCab:

### 1. Payload Capacity

*   **4WD XLT SuperCab (2.7L EcoBoost V6):** The maximum payload for a 2024 F-150 XLT SuperCab 4WD with the 2.7L EcoBoost V6 engine is approximately **1,605 lbs** (Edmunds). The payload capacity can vary based on other options and configurations.
*   **3.5L PowerBoost Hybrid Engine:** The addition of the 3.5L PowerBoost Hybrid V6 engine generally results in a lower payload capacity due to the added weight of the battery and electric motor. For comparison, a 4x4 SuperCrew with the PowerBoost Hybrid has a maximum payload of **1,755 lbs** (Ford). The payload for a SuperCab with the hybrid engine would be in a similar range, but slightly lower than a comparable non-hybrid 3.5L EcoBoost model.

### 2. Comfort Features: XL vs. XLT

*   **Heated Seats:** Optional on both the XL and XLT trims. They are included as a standard feature in higher XLT packages like the 302A High Package.
*   **Wireless Android Auto:** Standard on both the XL and XLT trims, as the SYNC 4 infotainment system with wireless smartphone integration is standard across the F-150 lineup.
*   **Cruise Control:** Standard on both the XL and XLT trims. Adaptive cruise control is available as an option on both.

### 3. XLT High Package (302A)

The XLT High Package (equipment group 302A) adds a significant number of comfort and technology features, including:

*   **Interior:** 10-way power driver’s seat, heated front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone electronic automatic temperature control, and a power-sliding rear window.
*   **Technology:** A 12-inch digital productivity screen (instrument cluster) and a 12-inch center-stack touchscreen display.
*   **Driver-Assist:** Ford Co-Pilot360 Assist 2.0, which includes adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, lane-keeping assist, and evasive steering assist.
*   **Convenience:** Remote start system, intelligent access with push-button start, and LED box lighting.

### 4. FX4 Off-Road Package

The FX4 Off-Road Package includes the following components:

*   **Mechanical:** Off-road tuned front shock absorbers, monotube rear shocks, an electronic-locking rear differential, and skid plates for the fuel tank, transfer case, and front differential.
*   **Driving Modes:** Hill Descent Control and a "Rock Crawl" drive mode.
*   **Payload:** The addition of the FX4 package slightly reduces the overall payload capacity of the truck due to the weight of the added components. The exact payload of an F-150 XLT with this package would depend on the specific engine and configuration, but it would be slightly less than a comparable non-FX4 model. For an F-150 with the 2.7L EcoBoost V6, the payload is up to 1,775 lbs, which would be reduced with the FX4 package (Ford).

### 5. Starting MSRP (4WD SuperCab)

*   **XL:** $43,380
*   **XLT:** $49,825
*   **Lariat:** The Lariat trim is not available in a SuperCab configuration for 2024. For comparison, the 4WD SuperCrew Lariat starts at $64,995.

### 6. Fuel Economy (EPA-Estimated Combined MPG)

*   **4WD 2.7L EcoBoost V6:** **21 MPG combined** (19 city/24 highway) (whites57ford.com).
*   **4WD 3.5L PowerBoost Hybrid:** **23 MPG combined** (22 city/24 highway) (tomwoodford.com).
