## Strengths & Weaknesses Analysis

### Strengths
1. Premium interior and features.
2. Standard 2.7L TurboMax engine provides ample power.
3. Autotrac 4WD system is more advanced than a standard part-time system.

### Weaknesses
1. **Payload capacity in the AT4 trim is insufficient.**
2. High purchase price, especially for the AT4 and Denali trims.
3. Used market pricing is unlikely to fit the project budget.

### Unique Considerations
- The Canyon is positioned as a more luxurious alternative to the Colorado, but this comes at the cost of payload and affordability.

## Recommended Configuration for Project Requirements

**Suggested Trim:** Elevation 4WD
**Reasoning:** The Elevation trim is the only one that meets the payload requirement, but it lacks the off-road features of the AT4. This would necessitate significant aftermarket modifications, which would need to be carefully managed to stay within payload limits.

**Configuration:**
- Cab: Crew Cab
- Bed: Short Box
- Engine: 2.7L TurboMax
- Key Options: Elevation Premium Package, Trailer Tow Package

**Projected Costs:**
- New MSRP: ~$46,295
- Estimated Spring 2027 used: ~$25,000 - $30,000
- Budget fit: Marginal

## Research Notes
